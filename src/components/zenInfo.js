                       <h1>What is Zen?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Zen is something we are, our true nature expressing
                        itself moment by moment. Zen is also something we do, a
                        disciplined practice through which we can realize the
                        joy of being.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is the practice of Zen? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Zen is a path that must be studied, practiced, and
                        actualized. The core of Zen is zazen, which requires
                        motivation, patience, discipline, and dedication, and is
                        cultivated through repeated, consistent practice.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is a Zen State of Mind? </h2>
                    <p>
                        Formal Zen practice begins with two basic activities: we
                        sit, and we breathe, with awareness. From that basic
                        engagement, we extend the activity to include walking,
                        chanting, eating, working and to every aspect of daily
                        life.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How do I find my Zen?</h2>
                    <p>
                        First, breathe in with full awareness. Appreciate it
                        fully. Then breathe out, slowly, with equal
                        appreciation. Hold onto nothing, give it all away.
                        Breathe in with gratitude; breathe out with love.
                        Receiving and offering is what we are doing each time we
                        inhale and exhale. To do so with conscious awareness, on
                        a regular basis, is the transformative practice we call
                        Zen Meditaion.

                    <h3>What Zen is Not</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many common misconceptions ZenInfo Zen. It is
                        important to know that Zen practice is not religion, is
                        not a belief system, is not a dogma or doctrine. One
                        does not have to be buddist to achieve a zen state of
                        mind.
