            "question": "How do I find my Zen?",
            "answer": "First, breathe in with full awareness. Appreciate it fully. Then breathe out, slowly, with equal appreciation. Hold onto nothing, give it all away. Breathe in with gratitude; breathe out with love. Receiving and offering is what we are doing each time we inhale and exhale. To do so with conscious awareness, on a regular basis, is the transformative practice we call Zen Meditaion."
